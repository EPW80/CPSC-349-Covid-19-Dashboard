# CPSC-349 Covid 19 Dashboard

Covid-19 Dashboard with React.js and Graphs for visualization.

**Aim** to acquire a knowledge of consuming an external Representational State Transfer (REST) API and presentation of data with graphs in React.js, the configuration of CI/CD with CircleCI and Netlify. The author has also planned to gain an understanding of ESLint (AirBnB Style Guide), snapshot testing in React.js, animations, and responsiveness.

**Features** of the Covid 19 Dashboard includes:

- Responsive UI design with Material UI and Styled-Components.
- Line Chart and Choropleth Map for data visualization using [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) and [React Simple Maps](https://www.react-simple-maps.io/).
- Animations.
- Information about the novel coronavirus, including transmission, symptoms, preventions.

## Overview

The COVID-19 Dashboard serves as a practical tool for visualizing various statistics related to the COVID-19 pandemic that originated in China. It has been developed with a focus on integrating external REST APIs, presenting data through graphical representations, and ensuring a responsive user interface.
